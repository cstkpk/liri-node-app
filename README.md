# liri-node-app

* The LIRI app is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface command line node application that takes in parameters and returns data.

* LIRI searches Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movie information, using axios to send these requests and retrieve data.

* LIRI can perform four basic functions:
1. To find movie information, type: movie-this name of movie
2. To find concert information, type: concert-this name of band
3. To find song information, type: spotify-this-song name of song
4. For a surprise seach, type: do-what-it-says. Then the program will read a command written in a text file and return the information to you.

* LIRI will also log all of your search results to a text file, called log.txt, so you can refer back to your newfound information!

* If at any point while using LIRI, you need help, type: help. This will return a menu of commands and basic instructions for how to use LIRI.
